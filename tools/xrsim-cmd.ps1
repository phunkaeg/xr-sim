# xrsim-cmd.ps1 - send control lines to the simulated runtime and WAIT for them
# to be applied.
#
# The simulator polls on its own thread, so the application does not need to be
# foregrounded for commands to be applied.
#
# It also waits for an acknowledgement instead of firing and hoping. The sim
# counts applied lines in state.json's cmdSeq, so a command that was never
# applied - or was rejected as a typo - fails here rather than silently doing
# nothing and being blamed on the mod three steps later.
#
# PositionalBinding is off so -Dir cannot swallow the first command.
#
# Usage:
#   .\tools\xrsim-cmd.ps1 "head rot 35 0 0"
#   .\tools\xrsim-cmd.ps1 "reset" "hand r point 0 0" "trigger r 1.0"
